HTACCESS

Enable / Disable directory Listing

To allow a web server to produce a directory listing, whenever you point a directory without index file. Add following line in your .htaccess file.Options +Indexes 
# or #
IndexIgnore *



To disable or prevent the directory access add following line in your .htaccess file. If user points the browsers to a directory which does not have index file then in this case 403 error will be

Options -Indexes 



Ignore files with specific extension

It may happen that you may need to ignore certain files to get displayed in directory listing. This can be achieved using IndexIgnore directive in .htaccess file.
Following snippet will not display .zip and .txt file in directory listing.IndexIgnore *.zip *.txt


Modify Index File

It is possible to change the default index file from index.html (index.php, index.jsp …) to any other file. Following line will change the index file to Home.html.DirectoryIndex Home.html

VALUES EMPTY IN ONSUBMIT
++++++++++++++++++++++++


Hmm... so it's empty on submit? Try adding this to the top of your php file:
if(empty($_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE']))
{ 
  $_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE'] = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; 
}

Okay, now check your php.ini (normally requires sudo or root in /etc):
post_max_size = 8M
variables_order = "EGPCS"

Do you have those two rules set? If so, be careful of how much memory you're allocating. Anything over 2048MB could start to give you trouble, depending on your system specs.

NOTE: If you make changes to your php.ini file and PHP is running as an apache module, you'll need to restart apache. Something along the lines of:
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart


search following in php.ini
post_max_size

The maximum value this variable accept is 14000M which is again a bug and should be 2047M
 So replace this varible with
post_max_size = 2047M

Value greater than 2047M is useless because $_POST can't save more than 2047M but due to bug this variable can accept the value for more than 2047M till to 14000M but remember assigning value for more than 2047M is useless.

CAKEPHP ==== AFTER LOGIN SUBMIT, IT IS NOT COMING TO LOGIN FUNCTION AT ALL, RATHER GOING TO

The solution: Remove all the white space after the end of } tag in controllers and models. Now, it works.

The reason(found in Google Search): ' the issue is a PHP issue with whitespace being output after some headers are sent, and typically occurs when a redirect is requested further down in the code from the whitespace. This issue has nothing to do specifically with CakePHP as implied in the post title.'

Thanks for help...
