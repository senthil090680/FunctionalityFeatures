HTACCESS

Enable / Disable directory Listing

To allow a web server to produce a directory listing, whenever you point a directory without index file. Add following line in your .htaccess file.Options +Indexes 
# or #
IndexIgnore *



To disable or prevent the directory access add following line in your .htaccess file. If user points the browsers to a directory which does not have index file then in this case 403 error will be

Options -Indexes 



Ignore files with specific extension

It may happen that you may need to ignore certain files to get displayed in directory listing. This can be achieved using IndexIgnore directive in .htaccess file.
Following snippet will not display .zip and .txt file in directory listing.IndexIgnore *.zip *.txt



 Modify Index File

It is possible to change the default index file from index.html (index.php, index.jsp …) to any other file. Following line will change the index file to Home.html.DirectoryIndex Home.html



The .htaccess file is a configuration file for the server. If there are errors in the file, the server will display an error message (usually with an error code of "500"). If you are transferring the file to the server using FTP, you must make sure it is transferred using the ASCII mode, rather than BINARY. We use this file to perform 2 simple tasks in this instance - first, to tell Apache to turn on the rewrite engine, and second, to tell apache what rewriting rule we want it to use. We need to add the following to the file:

RewriteEngine On    # Turn on the rewriting engine
RewriteRule    ^pet-care/?$    pet_care_info_01_02_2008.php    [NC,L]    # Handle requests for "pet-care"

A couple of quick items to note - everything following a hash symbol in an .htaccess file is ignored as a comment, and I'd recommend you use comments liberally; and the "RewriteEngine" line should only be used once per .htaccess file (please note that I've not included this line from here onwards in code example).

The "RewriteRule" line is where the magic happens. The line can be broken down into 5 parts:
RewriteRule - Tells Apache that this like refers to a single RewriteRule.
^/pet-care/?$ - The "pattern". The server will check the URL of every request to the site to see if this pattern matches. If it does, then Apache will swap the URL of the request for the "substitution" section that follows.

pet_care_info_01_02_2003.php - The "substitution". If the pattern above matches the request, Apache uses this URL instead of the requested URL.

[NC,L] - "Flags", that tell Apache how to apply the rule. In this case, we're using two flags. "NC", tells Apache that this rule should be case-insensitive, and "L" tells Apache not to process any more rules if this one is used.

NC - not case sensitive

L - no more rules to process


# Handle requests for "pet-care" - Comment explaining what the rule does (optional but recommended)

The rule above is a simple method for rewriting a single URL, and is the basis for almost all URL rewriting rules.
